I have created a portfolio that utilizes HTML and CSS for the interface design, providing a visually appealing layout. For dynamic functionality, I incorporated JavaScript, enhancing user interaction and experience. Additionally, I employed SQL for database management, ensuring efficient data handling and storage. This project showcases my skills in front-end and back-end development, demonstrating a well-rounded approach to web development.
